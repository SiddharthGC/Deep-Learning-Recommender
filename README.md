# Deep-Learning-Recommender-System
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2018

Project work from my 7th semester at PSG College of Technology. Formed the first component of my final year dissertation.

The first jupyter notebook in the repo is a simple neural network implementation. It was a training exercise given to me by my project guide.

The second notebook was my first attempt at using TensorFlow to implement LSTM networks.

The third notebook titled "Main file" contains the LSTM recommender and the custom architecture recommender. You can view the code and the results.

The pdf file titled "Project report" contains all the details about the project. Read it if you would like to know more.
(NOTE : I have removed the first few title pages from the pdf as I am not allowed to share that information)

Please do not copy or plagiarize any of my work. You can view the pdf file for reference, but please cite my work as a source.
